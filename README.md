# Decryption

## What Is This?
A program that accepts an encrypted string, decrypts it based on a set of rules, and then returns the decrypted message.

## Rules
The decryption follows these rules:
1. If the character is '*', convert it to 'a';
2. If the character is '&', convert it to 'e';
3. If the character is '#', convert it to 'i';
4. If the character is '+', convert it to 'o', and;
5. If the character is '!', convert it to 'u'.

## To Clone This To You Machine...
```
git clone https://github.com/ryesgit/decryption-2.git
cd decryption-2/
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
